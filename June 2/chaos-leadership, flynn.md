# Leadership through Chaos, by Aisha Blake
Co-Owner of Opal Grove Games? A GM?! Who even cares about her Pluralsight gig, that's way more interesting!

Apology to anyone reading these notes, there miiiight... will be some less work relatedd notes as she draws parallels between running a tabletop game and managing a team.

1) Player/Team member safety. Safety is your top priority, including YOUR safety. 
2) Encouraging Feedback. Make it easy, and incorporate it into your work (Positive as well!). Watch for bias!

## Core Needs (BICEPS)
Belonging: your team's sense of community. Do they feel close to the group, as if they belong. *Make sure party members gel well, maybe have out of game activities*

Improvement: Want to feel progress, as if they're moving forward. Acheiving new things. *Don't need anything as concrete as "gather the five sacred stones" but like, have real goals they attain and don't take that away*

Choice: Do they have agency in their work? Can they make a **meaningful** decision about what happens? *make choices in how they attain objectives matter beyond reflavoring a final combat or somesuch*

Equality: "Fairness." Equal opportunities, equal access to support/resources, equal pay. Reciprocity; do they feel like their contributions matter equally? *Make sure nobody overshadows the other players, don't let anyone's backstory or improv ddominate the scene*

Predictability: A degree of certainty, being able to have expectations and have them met. *Not everything needs to be a gotcha moment, you can have an impactful story without yanking the rug from beneath them*

Significance: That what you're doing matters, that what you're improving in and making progress on contributes to a greater whole. *Re-inforcing the role of their quest/s in the greater world; providing recognition in game of achievements*


## Flavors of Chaos: Have an eldritch blast!
- Lack of direction
    - Plan Backwards
    - Link objectives together
    - Include multiple paths
    - Let your team's skills/capacity be your guide
- Burnout
    - Start Slow
    - Regular check-ins
    - Mix up work
- Conflict (between team members)
    - Set expectations early
    - Shut issues down ASAP
    - People may leave
- Large-Scale Trauma
    - Will affect some more than others
    - Consider altering the workload
    - Keep discussion intentional and respectful
- Personal Tragedy
    - You are not a therapist
    - Everyone reacts differently

## Session Zero: Yay for zero indexed arrays!
Set expectations, establish direction, how have people skilled up. Get feedback, talk about past feedback.

"Personal User Manuals": a guide to how to potentially interact with you.
- Values (what's important to you?)
- Communication (how to contact? How to communicate best?)
- Preferences (what do you enjoy, what annoys you?)
- Growth (What areas could you improve in?)

Balance prep and improvisation
Learn your own style
you don't have to know everything
Trust your reports
You control the flow of information, but it's not an adversarial relationship
