# The Wind and the Waves, Sarah Drasner
Problems are not solved in a single flash of inspiration.

"The Manchester Baby" is my favorite cryptid.

There's a lot of talking about "what is computer" and not enough "why is computer" or "WHO WAS PHONE"

The Lightbulb was Thanos. (Inevitable)

"I am angular's grandma" *laugh track* *slap guitar sting* *Jimmy Kimmel dies of laughter*

Angular came after some things, before other things, and at the same time as yet other things! Hard hitting FACTS. 

She's describing different waves of JS libraries, but mostly it's just a lot of...listing names. She's just really pitching Angular, I think, more than anything else.

"Angular is reactive to changes! Like, you know, Vue, or Solid, or almost any other web framework has in some form or fashion."

Angular is coming up with suspense, it sounds like, how nice for them.

"Oh, yeah, you heard of a little thing called 'Typescript?' YOU'RE WELCOME AMERICA, ANGULAR DID THAT.

 But also we took way too long to use Typescript for strongly typed forms." --Sarah, in summation

Angular has better CSS now.

There's a bunch of streamlining going on in Angular to reduce boilerplate and improve DX.
