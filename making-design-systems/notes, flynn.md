# Making Design Systems People Actually Use
Speaker is Dan Mall, creator of Design System University which opens on the 5th.

*Lookup DSU "Study Hall" talks.*

We'll get an online version of the content after the talk? So, these notes won't be the only thing.

Can get a certificate from DSU, yay?

    Why do retired mathmeticians often end up as gravediggers? They enjoy the cemetery/symmetry.

*Design Systems, a good book by Alla Matova*

A design system is both every piece, and the separate pieces. (Much like if you break a big rock down, the smaller pieces are also rocks)

Have to avoid putting the work in the wrong place; don't spend a whole week mocking stuff in figma, when you could very quickly do something in actual CSS or whatnot.

*Anders Flanders, weird one man band*

Trying to do it all by yourself is going to burn you out, and probably suck; don't suck, join together design, product, and engineering.
### Parts of a design system: (There is no secret to keeping design in sync with code)
 - UI Kit
 - Component Library (A collection where you can browse examples and find code snippets to implement components in a codebase)
 - Guidelines
 - Reference Sites
 - Digital Products
 - Design Tokens too?
UI Kits help designers, Component Libraries help engineers, and Design Systems help **Product Teams.**

*Thinking in Systems, Donella ____*

Where Design Systems often fail is in the interconnectivity, in people doing their own thing (Desginers, Engineers, Product)

*So, definitely seems like you want to set things up so that designers can speak into a repository which you can pull into code, seems like.*

Worked with a company who spent 11 months and 16mil to change yellow buttons to purple. No system for branding/design.

Gotta. Be. Connected!
## Q and A

*Do companies really want 3rd party libraries pushing updates to their code and whatnot?*

Less likely for a company to want updates pushed from a 3rd party, but a connected system for a **custom** design system, is very valuable.
The best use cases for a 3rd party library is for rapid prototyping, or for a startup who haven't gotten to the maturity to need their own.
Another value may be things like accessibility or localization baked in to the base, to be layered on top of.

*Most people won't have luxury of building it all out from ground zero; how best to roll out a design system for in motion development?*

The short answer is "bird by bird". Basically, one piece at a time; one component at a time. Hey, almost agileish; release smallest helpful value, then the next helpful value. The long answer will be the subject of the rest of the day.

*A question I didn't fully understand about snowflakes and different levels of design systems*
