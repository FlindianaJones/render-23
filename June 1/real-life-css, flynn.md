# CSS in the real world, Chris Coyier
This guy is a weirdo.

Dunks on Bethany Hamilton, which is welcome but confusing.

Wooooo, dvh vs vh! This guy just always feels like he thinks only smart people get his jokes, and if you're not laughing you are the dumb. Don't love that feeling.

Ways to have things flow more organically: border-inline-start vs border-left! border-block-end vs border-bottom! inline-size vs width! margin-trim murders margin? border-size vs height!

This guy hates his x's, and likes confronting the camera?

inset-inline something instead of bottom, and something similar for left? 

Gradients can't quite do inline-end or whatnot, so womp womp. People are always translating your website, even if that's not what you intended. Or into languages you didn't intend.

Alt Text should help you to feel the things that the image is intended to evoke. 

This guy CSS's, he hates mobile browsers covering up page elements. Use grid instead of flexbox, way less css-tricks visiting! Grids are nice, and subgrids (which are coming!) allow you to inherit a parent container's grid layout, which is nice. 

I think what I really dislike about this guy is that he gives off big "you can't tell a joke anymore!" vibes.

Container...units? You can do container type, have to set that up, then use cqi and it scales it based on the container size! :o

Container Query Units and Fluid Typography, Stephanie Eck__

Starts a point about how you can't know where a component will render, finishes it with container queries will fix that by being like a viewport, but for a specific container! Parent has to be the container, then style the children.

layers?!?!? A way of specifically laying out hierarchies, so that you don't need to use a bunch of specificity engineering! You can throw bootstrap, or whatnot, into an unnamed layer and then your stuff wins because no layer is higher than...other layer. 

Apparently CSS hasn't kept up with colors super duper; OKLCH! Okay, lich.
Lightness, Chroma, Hue, and OK. Color spaces? Probably need to research that. 

viewTransitions API! You get it for freeee? And you can use names to link things together.
