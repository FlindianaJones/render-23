# CSS in the real world, Chris Coyier
This guy is a weirdo.

Dunks on Bethany Hamilton, which is welcome but confusing.

Wooooo, dvh vs vh! This guy just always feels like he thinks only smart people get his jokes, and if you're not laughing you are the dumb. Don't love that feeling.

Ways to have things flow more organically: border-inline-start vs border-left! border-block-end vs border-bottom! inline-size vs width! margin-trim murders margin? border-size vs height!

This guy hates his x's, and likes confronting the camera?

inset-inline something instead of bottom, and something similar for left? 

Gradients can't quite do inline-end or whatnot, so womp womp. People are always translating your website, even if that's not what you intended. Or into languages you didn't intend.

Alt Text should help you to feel the things that the image is intended to evoke. 

This guy CSS's, he hates mobile browsers covering up page elements. Use grid instead of flexbox, way less css-tricks visiting! Grids are nice, and subgrids (which are coming!) allow you to inherit a parent container's grid layout, which is nice. 

I think what I really dislike about this guy is that he gives off big "you can't tell a joke anymore!" vibes.

Container...units?
