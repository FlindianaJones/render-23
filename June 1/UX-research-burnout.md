# UX Research & Self Care, Brenda Hoyle
More low quality crowd riffing from that one guy; no hate, I just find most crowd riffing to be bottom of the barrel humor. Waiting on yet more tech issues it looks like? Should probably stop burning out our HDMI connectors or some'in. 

UX Cafecito at Techqueria? What do those words meeeeaaaaan? 

Content Warning: It may get awkwardly personal. Exciting. 

What is self care? It is practice and process of dealing with your health, in every dimension. 

Problem with traditional self care instructions: all focused around after work, or outside of work.

She cares about ethics in research partly due to an experience where someone broke down crying on her, and she took care of them then took it home with her.

"Compassion Fatigue" is the stress and emotional impact of helping others through their trauma and own stress. 

"Emotional Labor" is the process of managing your feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of your job.

"Burnout" is of course the low energy, high frustration state you can get in if you perform too hard too long.

Team Wellness check example
 - How am I feeling?
 - What can I do to feel better?
 - What can others do to help me feel better?
 - **What would I like to share?** (This is the only one that MUST be shared)

 Personal Wellness check before heading in
 - How am I feeling?
 - How can this session affect me?
 - How can I affect the session, the participants, and others based on how I'm feeling right now?

 Both of these are examples of ```Mindfulness``` which is basically just self reflection.

 Going to be honest, this is weirdly specific, and not as helpful to my work as I'd have hoped. Ah well, I'll finish the session, for JUSTICE.

 Go easy on yourself; that's applicable to everyone, except me, who is hard on myself because ***I*** deserve it.
