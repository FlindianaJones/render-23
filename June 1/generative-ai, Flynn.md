# A Whole New World with Generative AI, Colby Fayock

Awkward wrestling style introduction; technical issues, again, but getting started as on time as we could! Speaker has a dope Final Space shirt, respeccies.

fay.io/render is where he shows off the prompts his images are based on. 

Basically going over all the use cases of AI; interestingly calls out way that AI is kinda scummy, lol, stealing people's voices/likeness.

Emphasizes how hard it is to provide a valuable prompt, lol. Obviously there's a lot of specificity needed, but pretending that this is some great achievement is a bit disingenuous.

Ah, excellent followup; "User prompts are NOT the future."

Pitching the idea of basically having an app that passes mad libs style prompts to OpenAI or such and then presents the results to users. 

There's a tool for turning a video into an article, interesting. 
A skybox generator? I wonder how that could be used...
Using AI to learn CLI commands.

Cloudinary! That's where he works, they're using AI for image transforms at least potentially.

Tweezer.app? It takes an image, it tries to auto-tag it, and it tries to determine the context in order to create a tweet based on just the image.

He has a free course on using the OpenAI SDK in NodeJS!
