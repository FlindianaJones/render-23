# WebAR with @heyashten

Mostly using `three.js`

WebXR: `XRSystem.requestSession()` & `XRSystem.requestAnimationFrame()`

... go somewhere unspecified to see her information on the AR hit test...

Looking for an ImageTriggerAR
- Recommends putting images in a database. No further info as to why other than having multiple image triggers in a scene.
- Unsure if that's helpful just for load times or just for in-experience performance, or something else entirely

Tools Stack:
- Server (Adobe Aero if you don't mind an App Clip)
- ARCore
- WebGL
- Languages (of which were listed a ton, obviously)

# That's.... that was it. More @ HeyAshten.com & coursera/SparkAR.
