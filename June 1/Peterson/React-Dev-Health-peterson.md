# React as a Developer Health Tool with Tejas Kumar

React's Intent: UI updates safely

React's Shortcomings:
- Runtime performance (bundle size, updates)
- Cognitive load
- Server focus (encouraged to use frameworks, data fetching done server side & then streamed to client)

*see "React without memo" video from React Conf*

Something about client vs. server bundles with little explanation.

Tools:
- See 'Replay' for cool User Flow Debugging

# That's all folks.
