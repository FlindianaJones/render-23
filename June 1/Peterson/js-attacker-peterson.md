# JS Attackers w/ @devdevcharlie - Charlie Gerard

**ILLEGAL BOI**

Working in Node.js ecosystem

- See event-source-polyfill: protestware
- NodeIPC included peacenotwar as a dependency

- Ransomeware: asymmetric encryption & demand payment

`// Create 2 keys, then script to create a file w/ public key and encrypt a folder`

- Sneaked as pre/postinstall script/*js file that runs dynamically fetched code* as part of a package's chunk in package.json. Can also make it called in a hook function that fires when a user imports it in their code

- Remote access / execute files: reverse shell
- Netcat command

I AM ROOT

**Hiding Malware**
1. Code obfuscation
2. Corrupt "resolved" URLS in package-lock.json
3. Bin script confusion (trick it into running something else upon npm / node commands)
4. VSCode extension
5. New npm packages

**Security Measures**
- Snyck or socket CLI or socket.dev/npm/package/package-name-here
- Manual checks
- Not installing things you don't need (& dependency changes) BUG BASH! :D
- Regularly update dependcencies
- Watch for typos
- Cybersecurity disaster recovery plan
