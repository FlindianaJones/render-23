# Seeing Eye to Eye - designing for low vision, by Homer Gaines
Background in psychology and behaviorology? Or somesuch.

There is way more to low vision accessibility than contrast!

WCAG 2.1, Perceivable 1.0 is all about vision and accessibility. 31.3% of the global population has low vision, something like 5% are outright blind. 

Low Vision is specifically the loss of some type of vision that is uncorrectable by artifical lens. So, blurry, hazy, peripheral vision loss, center vision loss are all types.

Accessible User Experience, or AUX. Users are likely to abandon programs that get too frustrating to use, so alienating vision issues has more than just annoyance ramifications. 

Low Vision is different experience to blind is different experience to fully sighted.

Headings are critical to screen readers, far more so than "find" or "reading through." 

Don't disable zoom or scaling, that removes access to users.

Action Items:
- Larger Fonts, like 16-18px for body copy.
- Distinguish your interactive elements from straight copy.
- Make sure your focus is clearly indicated.
    - Use box-shadow instead of outline is more cross-browser, because even Safari respects it. Safari!
- Use responsive layouts, not just reponsive content
- Group labels to inputs, not spreading it out across the screen
- Don't forget smaller laptops!
    - And larger tablets, for that matter

4.5:1 is the target contrast ratio; 83.6% of websites failed in some way or another in Web Aim's audit. Personal anecdote about how a developer once literally couldn't see UI elements in their app because they were designed too low contrast. A personal anecdote about not being able to see charts in a shareholder meeting.

Don't use black text on a white background; use Charcoal Gray instead.
And in Darkmode, use Charcoal Gray for the dark or offwhite.

Darkmode can cause Halation, in people with astigmatism. Can fight with better color combos and bigger fonts.

You need to use your empathy to drive action to change for the better.
