# Whimsical Interactions with React, Josh Comeau

Josh apparently is good at Dance Dance Revolution, which is a fun fact.
When Josh gets old, I'm going to call him Josh Comeauver, unless he shaves his head aggressively. Then I'm going to call him bald Josh.

The Emcee is "not trying to make things awkward as hell" but man. That is exactly what my trying to make things awkward as hell would look like. Different strokes for different weirdos. 

Emcee asks about what starting your own thing looks like; Josh's answer is to start building a base, tweeting, blogging. Then, you can start on a course, and people will be far more likely to sign up for it.

In answer to biggest mistake he made, terrible launch of his course, specifically around a coupon code? Don't write coupon checks your POS can't cash, is a lesson.

WHEN IS THE ACTUAL CONTENT. NOW WE ARE DISCUSSING DDR. Ooooooh, technical issues are why we're killing so much time, forgive the previous salt. 

Emcee participated in cosplay day, dressing up as an unfunny ball of nervous energy. ZING Oh look, another extrovert trying to force everyone to meet people they want to, what a classic song. Play it again, Sam. Of course he has a podcast :|

Nearly 20 minutes late, yay. 

He's from Montreal, I wonder if he drinks pepsi like a godless heathen.

Stripe is a great example of interaction and stuff; it looks different on the landing page vs when you log in, because the dashboards and stuff are all so boring, they...ought to use react? Basically, he's calling React boring and staid. 

He's got a fun blog! With like, a like button that is super interactive and adorable. 

We're going to make a cute egg, apparently!

Listening to mouse events, and gets bounding rect, then goes through the math to figure out where to rotate the element. But wait! This is slow! And if you have a craptop, it'll stutter. First pass: move the boundingRect call outside the mouse handler; but of course you can't never update it.
So, better would be putting in event handlers for other events, like scrolling, resizing, mutation...and having them track the boundingRect there, on less common events.

hard to read code...but he's using an SVG with react state and such plugged into its rendering. He's using a custom hook, woohoo!

He's using Spring; using a Spring object to get tween values? And then rendering an unpacked ANimatedSVG, to smooth the motion. 

He originally wanted to end the talk here, but then he didn't! Dun dun...3D object in blender?!?!?!?!?!??!?!!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!
He did it, the madlad did it!!!
He's using 3JS though, specifically react3/fiber? You can use Spring, apparently, to smooth out the rotation in 3JS as well! Huh! There are environment presets, for like lights and stuff. Huh, he does really interesting stuff with 3JS and React, I should look into that.

He's appreciative for our attention and patience, as he should be. His first course was "CSS for Javascript Developers" Coupon code RENDER will work, maybe; joshcomeau.com/render
