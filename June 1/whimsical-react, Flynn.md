# Whimsical Interactions with React, Josh Comeau

Josh apparently is good at Dance Dance Revolution, which is a fun fact.
When Josh gets old, I'm going to call him Josh Comeauver, unless he shaves his head aggressively. Then I'm going to call him bald Josh.

The Emcee is "not trying to make things awkward as hell" but man. That is exactly what my trying to make things awkward as hell would look like. Different strokes for different weirdos. 

Emcee asks about what starting your own thing looks like; Josh's answer is to start building a base, tweeting, blogging. Then, you can start on a course, and people will be far more likely to sign up for it.

In answer to biggest mistake he made, terrible launch of his course, specifically around a coupon code? Don't write coupon checks your POS can't cash, is a lesson.

WHEN IS THE ACTUAL CONTENT. NOW WE ARE DISCUSSING DDR. Ooooooh, technical issues are why we're killing so much time, forgive the previous salt. 

Emcee participated in cosplay day, dressing up as an unfunny ball of nervous energy. ZING Oh look, another extrovert trying to force everyone to meet people they want to, what a classic song. Play it again, Sam. Of course he has a podcast :|

Nearly 20 minutes late, yay. 

He's from Montreal, I wonder if he drinks pepsi like a godless heathen.
